## Core Components

### CLAUDE.md - Foundational Standards

The main configuration file defining:
- **NASA Documentation Standards** (NPR 7120/7123/8735)
- **3-Factor Ruling** for tool/workflow evaluation
- **7-Phase Scientific Method** (OBSERVE → THINK → PLAN → BUILD → EXECUTE → VERIFY → LEARN)
- **Mission & Success Metrics** (CTR 5-7%, AVD 40-50%, 30-sec retention 70%+)
- **Research Methodology** with depth requirements
- **Session Continuity** protocols

### Skills

#### nasa-documentation-standards
NASA-style documentation with lifecycle phases, technical reviews, QA/QC, IV&V, and configuration management.

#### research-integration
9-step research workflow (INTAKE → FETCH → ANALYZE → CONTEXTUALIZE → DOCUMENT → INDEX → IMPLEMENT → AUDIT → REPEAT) for transforming sources into actionable knowledge.

#### kaizen
Continuous improvement methodologies including root cause analysis, PDCA cycles, and problem-solving frameworks.

#### reflexion
Self-reflection and learning patterns for iterative improvement.

## Integration

This framework integrates with:
- **DeadManAI_Research** - Research repository (R01-R38+)
- **DeadManAI_Runtime** - Operational state management
- **AI_Pipeline** - Production workflows

---

## Usage

### For Team Members

1. Review `CLAUDE.md` for foundational standards
2. Reference skills in `skills/` for specific workflows
3. Follow 3-Factor Ruling for all tool evaluations
4. Maintain NASA documentation standards

### For Claude Code

Files are symlinked from `C:\Users\Administrator\.claude\`:
- `CLAUDE.md` → Framework/CLAUDE.md
- `settings.json` → Framework/config/settings.json
- `skills/` → Framework/skills/
